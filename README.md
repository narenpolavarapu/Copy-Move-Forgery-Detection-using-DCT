# Copy-Move-Forgery-Detection-using-DCT
Digital images that are frequently encountered in
day-to-day life can be easily tampered to mislead the information.
One of the popular methods used to accomplish this unauthorized
alteration is copy-move forgery. This project presents a passive
authentication scheme for copy-move forgery which uses discrete
cosine transform (DCT) with block-wise peak-pixel-based block
clustering. This scheme initially aims to obtain the features by
implementing DCT on small, fixed image blocks and minimizes
the size of feature vectors. The block-wise peak-pixel-based block
clustering algorithm is used instead of the general lexicographic
order technologies to enhance the detection precision. By com-
paring the feature vectors in each bucket, similar blocks will
be obtained. Based on the experimental outcomes, the proposed
scheme can detect multiple irregular and significant tampered
regions. The duplicated regions detected in the distorted digital
images can also be displayed by adding white Gaussian noise,
Gaussian blurring and their mixed operations. By applying the
above approach to the CoMoFoD - Image Database we have
achieved an accuracy of 83.33%.
